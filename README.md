## Description

This project is a personal portfolio written using React. This was actually an interesting and exciting project to work on for me because this is something I had wanted to do on my own. React offers a lot of flexibility in designing dynamic web pages with faster loads while maintaining consistency and structure throughout the application. React is a very well known and used framework for writing robust web pages and it was something I really wanted to make sure I understood and will continue to practice and develop my skillset with this going forward. I had a lot of fun doing this project and I learned a great deal about interaction between elements, scripts, app structure, and writing dynamic code allowing me to insert automatically styled elements and containers when I add new objects. I tried to challenge myself with this one to do a few things I hadn't known that came to mind and I also learned more about the bootstrap framework and how their styles interact with each other. Both were fun to learn and even though I encountered several issues in the process, I enjoyed the experience.
