      <p>
        Hello! My name is Ryan Caltabiano and I am currently learning web design through
        UCF's full-stack coding boot camp. Through this program I have learned much about 
        front and back-end technologies such as Node, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, and React. 
        I also challenge myself to research, study, and apply the things I learn through
        various projects that I will list here. I thank you for visiting my portfolio. If
        you wish to reach me, you can find my contact information below as well as a form
        to submit to which I will respond at the soonest opportunity. Thank you!

      </p>
